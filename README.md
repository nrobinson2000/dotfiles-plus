# dotfiles-plus

Like [arch-base](https://github.com/nrobinson2000/arch-base) but better.

## Installation

After installing Arch Linux, log in as a non-root user with sudo access.

Run the following to install my packages and settings to replicate my desktop environment:

```
./install
```

Since this script does not make any assumptions about your graphics card or
bootloader you should install and configure the appropriate packages if
necessary.


## Notes

This script was designed with good intentions and to speed up the process of
installing Arch Linux. There may be bugs and I do not accept any liability for
damage this script may cause to your system.
